    Hello, my name is Andrew D’Onofrio, welcome to my portfolio for Fast Robots (MAE4190)! Please read through for projects relating towards in-depth documentation on mechatronics and complex systems.
</p>

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University in the College of Engineering. I am currently exploring my interests in mechanical design and product development for medical applications, however, I am open to all related applications of mechanical problem-solving towards product development. Currently, I am a current Project Manager of the Cornell DEBUT project team, an undergraduate researcher for Dr. Yadong Wang’s Lab in collaboration with Anova Biomedical Inc., and a member of Cornell’s Rapid Prototyping Lab. Previously, I was a design consultant for Rev: Ithaca Start-Up Works and a visiting research intern for Dr. Yi-Xian Qin’s Lab at Stony Brook University.
<br><br>

Professionally, I am primarily involved in diagnostics and disposables in the MedTech industry. I am a previous Operations Development Leadership Program (OLDP) Intern at Siemens Healthineers, focused on improvements in liquid formulation processes. Additionally, I am a previous preCARDIA Product Development Co-Op at J&J Heart Recovery, developing engineering testing equipment and workflows for characterization of interactive console units.

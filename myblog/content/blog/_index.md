    Hello, my name is Andrew D’Onofrio, welcome to my portfolio for MAE 4190: Fast Robots! Please read through for projects relating towards in-depth documentation on mechatronics and complex systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
    I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University in the College of Engineering. I am currently exploring my interests in mechanical design and product development for medical applications, with specific experience in electromechanical design and mechanical therapy/ diagnostic devices.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
    I am excited to explore mechtronic systems through the Fast Robots class, learn as much as possible, and walk away with an awesome project!

### Summary (1A and 1B)

Lab #1 is a basic introduction of the Artemis Nano board and interacting with the Arduino IDE, through both direct connection and BLE. In Lab #1A, the Artemis board is configured for a MacBook (M2 Pro) and basic scripts are executed including Blink, Serial, AnalogRead, and Microphone Output. In Lab #1B, bluetooth communication is established through Jupyter Notebook to wirelessly communicate with the Artemis board, and basic verification testing scripts are conducted to confirm a reliable connection.
